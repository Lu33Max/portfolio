        Hi, my name is Lucas Maximilian Ernst, 20 years old and an enthusiast for games and the workings behind them. 
        What originally only started out as a hobby about 10 years ago with hacks for Super Mario 64 has long since become part of my everyday life and with my studies hopefully also my career.
        Since then I&apos;ve been steadily increasing my skills and knowledge about design fundementals and the process of creating games and have developed a keen eye for details...
